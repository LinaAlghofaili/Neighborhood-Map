# Neighborhood Map Project

This is a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood. I added some functionality to the map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


## Features
- [x] Google Maps API
- [x] Foursquare API
- [x] React

3. Install dependencies using`npm` command line tool
